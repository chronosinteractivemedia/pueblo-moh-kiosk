        "bio": "Pvt. Bill Crawford was a squad scout in action with the enemy near Altavilla, Italy, 13 September 1943, when his Company was attacked on Hill 424 by an enemy-held position. After reaching the crest of a hill, his platoon was pinned down by intense enemy machine-gun and small-arms fire. Locating one of these guns, which was dug in on a terrace on his immediate front, Pvt. Crawford, without orders and on his own initiative moved over the hill under enemy fire to a point within a few yards of the gun emplacement and singlehandedly destroyed the machine gun and killed three of the crew with a hand grenade, thus enabling his platoon to continue its advance. When the platoon, after reaching the crest, was once more delayed by enemy fire, Pvt. Crawford again, in the face of intense fire, advanced directly to the front midway between two hostile machine-gun nests located on a higher terrace and emplaced in a small ravine. Moving first to the left, with a grenade he destroyed one gun emplacement and killed the crew; he then worked his way, under continuous fire, to the other and with one grenade and the use of his rifle, killed one enemy and forced the remainder to flee. Seizing the enemy machine gun, he fired on the withdrawing Germans and facilitated his company's advance.",

        "bio": "Ordered to break through enemy-infested territory to reinforce his battalion 29 November 1950, Capt. Sitter continuously exposed himself to enemy fire as he led his company forward and, despite 25 percent casualties, succeeded in driving through to his objective. He reorganized his depleted units the following morning and led them up a steep frozen hillside under blistering fire, encouraging his troops as casualties occurred and directing forward platoons to drive to the top of the ridge. The enemy launched a vicious counterattack, setting the hill ablaze with mortar and machine-gun fire taking a heavy toll in troops. Capt. Sitter visited each foxhole, deploying reinforcing units consisting of service personnel unfamiliar with infantry tactics into a combat team instilling in every man the determination to hold his position at all costs. With the enemy penetrating his lines in counterattacks requiring hand-to-hand combat, and infiltrating to the command post with hand grenades, he fought gallantly with his men in repulsing and killing the fanatic attackers in each encounter. Painfully wounded in the face, arms, and chest by bursting grenades he refused to be evacuated and continued to fight on until a successful defense of the area was assured. His valiant leadership and superb tactics throughout 36 hours of bitter combat reflect the highest credit upon Capt. Sitter and the U.S. Naval Service.",

Murphy, although painfully wounded by fragments from an enemy mortar shell, steadfastly refused medical aid and continued to lead his men up a hill through a withering barrage of hostile mortar and small-arms fire, skillfully maneuvering his force and shouting words of encouragement. Undeterred by the increasing intense enemy fire, he located casualties as they fell and made several trips up and down the fire-swept hill to direct evacuation teams to the wounded, personally carrying many of the stricken marines to safety. With all the wounded evacuated, he remained behind to cover the movement of friendly forces off the hill. After reaching the base of the hill, he organized a search party for a final check on missing marines, locating and carrying the bodies of a machine-gun crew down the hill. Wounded a second time through a continuing barrage of enemy small-arms, artillery, and mortar fire, he again refused medical assistance until assured that every one of his men, including all casualties, had preceded him to the main lines. His resolute and inspiring leadership, exceptional fortitude, and great personal valor reflect the highest credit upon 2d Lt. Murphy and enhance the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.",

Dix, with a patrol of Vietnamese soldiers, was recalled to assist in the defense of Chau Phu. Learning that a nurse was trapped in a house near the center of the city, S/Sgt. Dix organized a relief force, successfully rescued the nurse, and returned her to safety. Being informed of other trapped civilians within the city, S/Sgt. Dix voluntarily led another force to rescue 8 civilian employees located in a building which was under heavy mortar and small-arms fire. S/Sgt. Upon approaching a building, he was subjected to intense automatic rifle and machine gun fire. He personally assaulted the building, killing 6 Viet Cong, and rescuing 2 Filipinos. The following day he assembled a 20-man force and under intense enemy fire cleared the Viet Cong out of the hotel, theater, and other buildings within the city. He then attacked enemy troops who had entered the residence of the Deputy Province Chief and rescued the official's wife and children. S/Sgt. Dix's heroic actions resulted in 14 confirmed Viet Cong killed in action, the capture of 20 prisoners, and the rescue of the 14 civilians. The heroism of S/Sgt. Dix was in the highest tradition and reflects great credit upon the U.S. Army.",
