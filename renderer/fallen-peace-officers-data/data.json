        "Biography": "Frederick House Barner was born in Susquahanna Township, Juniate County, Pennsylvania on July 20, 1860. He married Edith C. Sell in Pueblo on October 17, 1888. Frederick worked as a conductor for the Santa Fe and Denver and Rio Grande Railroads before he joined the Pueblo Police Department in 1908. He was survived by his wife and three boys, Roy 17, Joseph, 15, and Carl, 11; parents Joseph and Sarah (House) Barner of Sioux Falls, South Dakota; five sisters and one brother.",
        "Incident": "Patrolman Frederick Barner, 48, was shot and killed at 10th Street and North Main on Sunday night, March 21, 1909. Officer Barner had arrested two men near 10th and Grand and walked them to the police call box on Main. As he opened the box to call for the patrol wagon, one of the men stepped back, drew a gun and shot Barner one time in the chest. The men fled east on 10th Street and disappeared in the vacant lots near the Grand Hotel. Detective Gray heard the shot and was at the scene within minutes. He found Barner dead from a shot through the heart.<br></br>Pueblo police officers were called out and a search for the suspects started. Many men were rounded up but eventually released for lack of evidence. Police believe that Barner had possibly captured two members of a gang that had been burglarizing residences along Grand Avenue. One strong suspect, Felis Martinez, was arrested and charged. Witnesses identified him by his description and a hat that was found at the scene. The weak part of this arrest was the determination that Barner was shot with a .41 caliber bullet and Martinez was carrying a .38 caliber revolver.<br></br>Las Animas County Undersheriff Kreegar came to Pueblo and interviewed Martinez and determined that he was probably innocent of the killing. Martinez was later released, and no one was ever convicted in the death of Officer Barner.",

Ryan of Pittsburgh and his brother Edwin.<br></br>Services were held on July 28 at St. Francis Xavier Church at Spruce and Logan. Mayor Fugard, a large contingent of police officers, firemen and city officials attended. Many friends and members of lodges that Dunleavy was a member of were also present. The city council passed a resolution honoring Dunleavy noting that he was \"<i>Brave in life....and surpassingly (sic) so in death.</i>\" Burial followed at Roselawn Cemetery.",
        "Incident": "Detective Sergeant John Dunleavy, 41, was shot and mortally wounded in the 1500 block of Pine just before 11:00 p.m. on July 21, 1909. He died from his wounds at 2:30 a.m., July 25. Dunleavy had finished his shift and while walking home, picked up his daughter from a friend's house when they were approached by two men. One made an insulting comment to Dunleavy's daughter and Dunleavy stepped forward putting her behind him. Dunleavy was then shot, fell to the ground and fired five times at the fleeing men, with no apparent effect. Dunleavy was rushed to Minnequa Hospital. Night Captain Charles Yund went to the hospital to get descriptions of the men and ordered all the detectives to Bessemer for a police dragnet.<br></br>Pueblo Police Chief Sullivan was notified and passed on the descriptions to other departments in the state and to the railroads. Dunleavy's partner that night was Detective Columbo Delliquadri. Just an hour or so earlier Delliquadri had stepped on a stone and sprained his ankle. Dunleavy assisted him to the streetcar line eight blocks away and then finished his shift alone. Investigators believed that the men that shot Dunleavy were planning to ambush both detectives and that Delliquadri's sprained ankle had kept him away from the attack. Detective Sergeant Dunleavy had earned a reputation for suppressing gambling and enforcing liquor laws in Bessemer. He was also responsible for the pawn shops in the area and recovered many stolen items. Chief Sullivan stated that Dunleavy had received \"<i>many 'Black Hand' letters threatening his life if he didn't let up on arresting people out his way.</i>\"<br></br>It was determined at the hospital that Dunleavy had been shot three times, in the leg, hip and just below the heart. Surgery was performed but the injures were too severe, and he died three days and three hours after being shot. At least 20 suspects were picked up by the police and all were eventually released. No one was ever convicted for the murder of Detective Sergeant Dunleavy.",

        "Biography": "Thomas Jefferson (Jeff) Evans was born in Kansas Territory (probably in Olathe, Johnson County) in January of 1857. He married his wife Tranquill in 1893, and they had three children. He lived at 1237 Bragdon Street and had worked for the Pueblo Police several times in the past and had recently rejoined the force. The funeral was held on Tuesday at the Whiton Chapel, and the body of Officer Evans was then escorted to the depot where it was taken by train to Lamar. He was buried the same day at the Riverside Cemetery in Lamar, next to his wife, who had died 16 years earlier. Jeff Evans was survived by his three children: Harry R. Evans, 25, of Canon City, Mrs. Julia Evans Kulp, 23 of Pueblo and Mrs. Frances Evans McKinsie, 19, of Denver.<br></br>The coroner's jury met again on Thursday (18th) to try and determine who was involved in the lynching. The Mexican government was represented to Senor A.J. Ortiz and attorney Ed J. Stark as counsel. Both Gonzales and Ortez were Mexican citizens. Seventeen witnesses testified but no one was able to identify anyone that took part in the affair. The coroner's jury was adjourned until September 30 at the request of Senor Ortiz in case some identity evidence might be discovered. No new information was discovered, and the coroner's jury issued the following statement: \"<i>We, the jury, find that Jose Gonzales and Salvador Ortez came to their deaths on September 13, 1919, by being hung by their necks in Pueblo County, Colorado, by persons unknown to this jury.</i>\" According to author Steve Leonard, this was the last lynching in Colorado.",
        "Incident": "Pueblo Patrolman Jeff Evans, 62, was shot and killed about 1:00 a.m. on Saturday, September 13, 1919, while walking his beat in the 500 block of West Second street in an area known as the \"Peppersauce Bottoms\". He apparently heard the cries of a woman who was quarreling with two men and came upon the scene from the alley. A brief conversation may have ensued before Evans was struck in the back of the head, knocked to the ground, then shot in the chest by the other man. Mr. & Mrs. Claude Hudson witnessed the shooting and stated that the two men were \"Mexicans\", drunk and had run off. Pueblo police Night Captain Jack Sinclair called out every available officer and detectives. Officer Evans was found on his back with his revolver near his hand. He had died almost instantly as the coroner determined that the bullet had cut the aorta and lodged in his back near the spine. Pueblo officers searching the Colorado-Kansas railroad station found three men sleeping in a passenger coach. All three were taken to the Hudson home on Second Street where they positively identified one of the men but said they had never seen the other two men. Officer John Miller had remained at the rail yard out of sight and a short time later found the other suspect hiding in the coach, wet to the waist because he had been hiding in the weeds until the other officers left. The second suspect had a revolver and 40 rounds of ammunition when arrested, was positively identified by the Hudson's and then jailed. The two \"Mexicans\" were part of a six-man section crew for the railroad that worked the daily train to Stone City.<br></br>Both suspects (Jose Gonzales & Salvadore Ortez) were in custody before daylight and the community was outraged by the murder of Officer Evans. Pueblo Chief of Police Daly said that the men denied everything at first, then admitted to being at the Hudson home but stated they were so drunk they did not know what they had done. The fate of the prisoners changed dramatically that evening. About 9:00 p.m., that evening the police received a call of a riot in the 1700 block of Schley Ave. Nigh Captain Sinclair, with a wagon load of officers rushed to Bessemer, leaving Desk Sergeant Garfield McCafferty alone at the city jail (in the \"old city hall\") with the city health officer. About 9:10 p.m. a \"mob\" of 50-100 approached the jail, disarmed a Pueblo officer nearby then pointed their guns through a window at the sergeant and the health officer. Holding them at gunpoint, others entered and obtained the jail keys then found the prisoners sleeping in a cell. Both were knocked unconscious, bound and \"<i>dragged out of the jail into automobiles and the mob proceeded at break-neck speed up Grand Avenue to Fourth Street and down west Fourth Street to the bridge.</i>\" The prisoners had ropes placed around their necks and then were thrown off the bridge over the waters of the Arkansas River. The mob dispersed. Meanwhile the police wagon realized that the riot call was a fake and returned to the jail to find out what had happened. They found the two victims of the lynching about 45 minutes later where a crowd then gathered while the officers waited for the coroner. In fact, officers had to move the crowd from the bridge for fear that the bridge would collapse. It was reported that this occurred during a driving rainstorm: and that it was very dark due to cloud cover. Sgt. McCafferty and the health officer both stated that the men wore hats or caps pulled down low to their eyes and blue or red handkerchiefs over their faces so they could not be recognized. The few words spoken were in a rasping voice and not identifiable either. Grover Shoup and Pueblo County Sheriff Thomas stated that they would... \"<i>ferret out and punish...the leaders of the vigilance committee which hung the two Mexicans last night.</i>\"<br></br>The coroner's jury met on Monday and Acting Coroner Mahar and Assistant DA Langdon conducted an investigation including interviews with four witnesses. They reached the following verdict: \"<i>Patrolman Jeff Evans came to his death on the night of September 13, 1919, at 508 West Second Street, Pueblo, Colorado, from the effects of a gunshot wound inflicted by Jose Gonzales after deceased had been felled to the ground by a blow delivered by Salvator Ortez and said blow and said gunshot were inflicted with felonious intent.</i>\"",

        "Incident": "Deputy William W. Green, 61, was working as a jailer or turnkey on October 15, 1918, when he was shot and killed by prisoner Clifford Sproul, 23, at 3:15 p.m. after Sproul's wife was allowed to bring him a change of clothes and basket of food. Green was escorting him back to his cell, when Sproul struck him on the back of the head and shot him as he fell. Sproul ran to the entrance and ordered the other turnkey, Joe Vetere, to unlock the gate. The unarmed Vetere did as he was told, and Sproul escaped.<br></br>Green had shouted when the attack occurred but was unconscious by the time Vetere got to him. He had a large gash on the back of his head and a bullet would just below his heart. He died 20 minutes later, before an ambulance arrived. Vetere stated that Deputy Green had examined the basket and clothing for weapons or prohibited items, but none were found. Sproul had just been sentenced to 4-8 years for burglary of the Elks Club and was a suspect in other business burglaries.<br></br>He was seen running from the jail and reported to be in a barn on 12th Street between Blake and Conley, about 6 blocks from the jail. Sheriff Britt and City Electrician Dotson climbed into the loft of the barn and found Sproul when the sheriff stepped on him in the hay. Detectives Baty and Walton, Undersheriff Grady and Mounted Officer Lovern were also searching the loft. Sproul was reportedly thrown from the loft to the men waiting below. When he was searched, a revolver and several shells were found in a specially made, concealed pocket in one leg of his trousers. According to his statement, killing Deputy Green was not his intention, he just wanted to escape. Sproul's wife Mattie was arrested for bringing the gun, but she denied doing so. Sproul stated he had received it from someone else several days before and denied that his wife had brought him the gun and that she knew nothing about his plan to escape.<br></br>The shooting aroused the people of Pueblo. A newspaper headline stated, \"Mobs Form to Lynch Negro; Spirited Away\". Sheriff Britt, the undersheriff and two U.S. Marshals transported Sproul to Colorado Springs due to the crowd sentiment after the shooting occurred. The article went on to say that \"...a mob of 75 persons appeared at the jail and demanded the negro be surrendered to them. Jailer Bradley told the mob that Sproul was not there, and to prove his statement, told them to appoint a committee to search the jail. This was done, and after the committee had inspected all departments of the immense jail, they reported to the crowd, which soon dispersed.\" Mattie Sproul was apparently not charged in this case.<br></br>Clifford Sproul was convicted of Murder and sentenced to \"death by hanging.\" He arrived in Canon City on March 18, 1919, and became prisoner #10671. His execution was scheduled in late June of 1919, but Governor Oliver H. Shoup commuted the sentences of Sproul and two other death row inmates to life in prison. Prison records indicated that he was born in Mississippi, lived in Pueblo and had previously served time in prison in Lansing, Kansas. His nickname was \"Dick the Digger\" due to his skill at digging through brick and stone walls into offices and strong rooms. He died in the prison hospital on October 17, 1920, at the age of 25.

        "Incident": "Corporal Thomas Hanson, 37, was shot and killed about 1:45 a.m. on Saturday, December 29, 1973, when he interrupted an armed robbery at a 7-11 store at Ninth and Grand, in Pueblo. Hanson and his partner, Officer James Askey, stopped at the 7-11 so Cpl. Hanson could buy a carton milk. Hanson entered the store while Askey remained in the patrol car. Unknown to the officers, a young man, later identified as Bernard Meehan, 19, was hiding behind one of the food shelves in the corner of the store. Officer Askey spotted the suspicious movements of Meehan, as the suspect approached Hanson near the counter. Meehan came up behind Hanson as the officer approached the counter and fired one round as Hanson turned toward him. Askey jumped from the cruiser and fired two rounds at Meehan just seconds after Cpl. Hanson fell to the floor. Meehan then staggered toward the door with his gun still in his hand. He turned toward Askey, was shot again and fell to the floor in front of the magazine display. Cpl. Hanson was rushed to Parkview Episcopal Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 2:15 a.m. Meehan arrived at the hospital a few minutes after Hanson was admitted and died three hours later. Deputy Coroner, Dr. John Howe said that the postmortem indicated that Hanson was killed by a .22 caliber bullet that entered a lung, severed a large blood vessel then entered the other lung and lodged in the torso. Pueblo Police spokesman John Ercul said that all three of Askey's shots struck Meehan. Both store clerks were laying on the floor behind the counter, which they had been told to do before Cpl. Hanson entered the store.<br></br>Investigators determined that another subject was involved and located him about 20 hours after the shooting. He was identified as Charles D. Salazar, 17, who had dropped out of Centennial High School. Salazar was jailed and subsequently indicted for murder in the death of Cpl. Hanson. He was alleged to have been the driver of \"get-away\" vehicle during the robbery with Meehan. Bond was set for $50,000 by District Judge Matt Kikel.

Officer Heine and other officers had been working multiple bar disturbances in the Historic Union Avenue District when they were dispatched to another fight at a place called Bongimo's. Nick and other officers took off on foot to the nearby bar. While running Nick told another officer he couldn't breathe then collapsed in the 300 block of Victoria Street. CPR was attempted at the scene and then for over two hours at Parkview Medical Center before he was pronounced dead about 5:00 a.m.<br></br>Pueblo County Coroner James Kramer later determined that Heine had a congenital heart defect that put his heart into a fatal, irregular rhythm. Officer Heine was in excellent health, and no one knew about the heart defect. It could have happened at any time but working in strenuous conditions appeared to have contributed to the heart condition. His mother, Corporal Pat Heine, also worked for the Pueblo Police Department.",

        "Incident": "Pueblo Officer Addison Hinsdale, 21, was accidentally shot about 6:30 p.m. on October 3, 1920, and died from his wound the next afternoon, Monday, October 4, at 2:30 p.m. at St Mary's Hospital. The bullet went thru the stomach and liver and doctors believed that he might survive but complications set in, and he passed away twenty hours after being shot. The situation that led to the shooting was a traffic crash which occurred on the western approach of the Northern Avenue viaduct. A car driven by Halley Butcher was traveling west over the viaduct when he was struck by a car being driven by Scott Reed. Reed's vehicle came from a side street and up the wrong side of Northern Avenue when the collision occurred. Officer Hinsdale and Officer Charles Meyers both were walking their respective beats, heard the crash and ran towards the scene from opposite directions. Reed was attempting to extricate his vehicle from the Butcher vehicle and possibly flee the scene. Officer Meyers seeing the Reed vehicle driving away fired three shots, aiming at the tires, to try and stop the car. Officer Hinsdale was shot once with the bullet entering his stomach and exiting his back. The other two shots also missed the car. Mr. Butcher picked up Hinsdale and took him to St. Mary's Hospital. Reed was arrested and charged with reckless driving.<br></br>Pueblo Police Chief Daly suspended Officer Meyers while an investigation was conducted. Reed was brought into Municipal Court the morning of October 4, found guilty of reckless driving and fined the maximum of $300.00. Reed stated that he was driving away because he thought Butcher was shooting at him. Officer Meyers stated immediately after the shooting that he thought that Hinsdale had been hit by a shot from a rooming house on Northern Avenue, but detectives discounted that after investigation. It was determined that one of the rounds fired by Officer Meyers struck Officer Hinsdale.\"<i>Meyers also said he believed that Reed was attempting to escape from the law, and that he felt justified in shooting at the fleeing motorist.</i>\" The newspaper noted that both officers had just recently been appointed to the Pueblo police force and had not received their uniforms. Both officers were in plain clothes while working that day. It is not known if Officer Meyers kept his job with the Pueblo Police Department.",

        "Incident": "Special Agent William F. (Will) Langdon, 64, was shot and killed in the East Santa Fe railyards in Pueblo at about 4 p.m. on December 10, 1915, after he observed four trespassers or \"hobos\" near the Pueblo Smelter. He told the junction operator that the men looked like the escaped suspects he had been looking for. Langdon approached the men, searched two of them and then called the other two down from the embankment. One stayed behind the other when they came down and he pulled out a revolver and shot Langdon as he started to search them. The first bullet struck him in the head and the other rounds hit him in the chest, left arm and abdomen. He died within minutes. The autopsy determined that the head and chest wounds were fatal shots.<br></br>The first two trespassers remained at the scene but the other two fled to the east along the tracks. They passed the tower where they were spotted by two railroad employees, the telegraph operator and the tower man, who, having heard the shots, followed them. The Pueblo police were notified and all available officers responded as did a special agent of the Santa Fe Railway.<br></br>The railroad employees followed the fleeing men across the Fountain River, north to Second Street, then to a barn at 316 E. Second Street. They reported where the men were hiding. Pueblo Police Chief Daly, Detective Grady and Patrolman McGovern searched the loft and found them hiding under hay. The suspects gave their names as Charles Lewis and Frank Williams. A further search of the loft by Detectives W. W. Green and Walton recovered a Luger semi-automatic pistol along with two .38-caliber revolvers, more than 200 rounds of ammunition and several bank bags. One of the guns, a blue steel .38-Army Colt, had been fired five times with one round still in the cylinder.<br></br>It was later determined that the real names of the pair were Joe Kitterman (alias Lewis), 27, and Lige Higgins (alias Williams), 39, who were wanted for three bank robberies in Kansas and Oklahoma. Kitterman was identified as the shooter by the tower man. The first two hobos who were not involved were later released. More specific information learned in the following days said that Kitterman and Higgins had been involved in three recent bank robberies in Chautauqua and Niotaze, Kansas, and Fort Gibbons, Oklahoma. They had been living at 1014 Cedar in Pueblo for three weeks.<br></br>The jury trial began on Monday, February 14, 1916, with Judge J. E. Rizer presiding and Deputy District Attorney Hughes prosecuting. Jury selection took three days. Testimony began on Thursday, and it was revealed that Langdon also carried a Pueblo County deputy sheriff's commission. Pueblo County Sheriff John McKee attended the trial and was responsible for the prisoners before and after the court sessions.<br></br>The defense attorneys claimed that Higgins had nothing to do with the shooting of Langdon, that Kitterman didn't know Langdon as a law officer, and that he fired in self-defense. Two witnesses testified that an examination of Langdon's gun showed it had not been fired for at least a week prior to the shooting. The court did allow the warrants from Chautauqua County, Kansas to be admitted as evidence to show motive for shooting Langdon. The trial concluded on February 23 with Kitterman convicted of second-degree murder and Higgins of voluntary manslaughter. Kitterman received a sentence of 25-45 years and Higgins received a 5-8-year sentence.<br></br>Both arrived in Canon City on March 3, 1916. Kitterman, prisoner 9912, was discharged September 15, 1952, after his sentence was extended for two escapes, in 1920 and in 1942. Higgins, prisoner 9913, was paroled on December 3, 1919 and discharged from parole on May 23, 1921.",

Officer Lovern was walking his beat the previous afternoon near Charles Longquest's Saloon on Union Avenue just north of the bridge, when he noticed something was wrong with his 'pistol belt'. It was just after 3:00 p.m., on May 10, when he entered the saloon to fix the problem. Lovern removed the belt, took the pistol from the scabbard and laid it on the glass cigar 'show' case. While he was working on the belt the pistol\" ...slipped off the slanting top of the case and in falling the hammer struck the projected edge of the counter and the pistol was discharged,\" Lovern was standing with his left side to the show case. The bullet went up cutting his coat and vest, through the coat collar and into Lovern's head just below the lobe of his left ear, shattering the base of his skull and tearing open the internal carotid artery, and exiting an inch and a half above and behind the ear. The bullet then passed through the corrugated iron ceiling and buried itself in the floor above.<br></br>The patrol wagon was summoned, and Officer Lovern was taken to Dr. McDonald's office. Pressure was kept on the ear to control the bleeding, and it was determined that the injury was fatal. The right side of his body was paralyzed and except for a brief moment just after the injury, he was unconscious the entire time. His family was summoned and with him when he died.",

        "Incident": "Officer Silas Martz (Marts), 43, was shot and killed on October 7, 1903, inside the Palace Drug store near 2nd and Main in Pueblo. Officer Marts was attempting to arrest Dr. Charles O. Rice, 44, who was drunk on alcohol and morphine and armed with a .45 caliber Colt revolver. About 8:00 p.m. Rice had become 'crazed'. He threatened the employees and customers and chased them from the store. A crowd estimated at 1000 people eventually gathered and the police held them back not knowing what Rice would do. Finally, about 9:30 p.m. Officers Marts and Daly entered the building and attempted to talk to Rice in a friendly manner. Dr. Rice waited until Marts was about 8' away and then fired one shot which struck Marts in the neck. With Daly's help, Marts was able to stagger out of the store and across the street. He was attended to immediately, but he died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital from a severed jugular vein.<br></br>Officer Elwin Slater was outside, and the crowd was jeering the police officers. Slater determined that he would sneak in and crawl around to where Dr. Rice was. About 9:45 p.m. he entered the store with his hand on his holstered gun. As he moved to a crouched position a gunshot was heard, and Slater was shot in the right leg. He was helped out of the drug store and taken to the hospital. Investigation afterward found that Slater had partially drawn his gun and accidentally shot himself when he crouched down. The bullet left a hole on the inside of his holster and entered his thigh which caused internal hemorrhaging. He died the next day, October 8, at 5:20 p.m. believing that he'd been shot by Dr. Rice, but that was not the case.<br></br>The drug store did not have a rear entrance and that hampered the efforts to capture Dr. Rice. Just before Officer Slater entered the store others were working on a different plan. Detective F. Rubichaud, Assistant Fire Chief Campbell and Firefighter Davenport had gained access to an adjoining business, went to the basement, removed a partition and found Dr. Rice passed out in the basement of the drug store. Rice was arrested and charged with murder. Dr. Rice had been the family physician for the Marts family for 12 years which may be why he thought he could talk Rice out of using the gun.",

They had a warrant to arrest Vertrees and were in his home when Vertrees attacked them. During the struggle Vertrees managed to grab the sheriff's revolver but was unable to fire it.

After getting his ticket he went to the saloon at about 5 p.m.<br></br>Dolman was waiting in the back room with Patterson's gun wrapped in some papers. He had told others that the wrapped package contained a fish he was going to have for supper. However, he had taken the eviction harder than was thought, and when Patterson arrived he grabbed the gun and shot him through the heart and then in the back as he fell. He then shot himself in the head. Patterson died almost instantly while Dolman died four hours later without regaining consciousness at St. Mary Corwin Hospital. Investigators concluded that Dolman had wanted to shoot both Patterson and Stein. Courthouse officials reported that he had made threats against Undersheriff Warren Hill and Constable Bradley too.",

        "Incident": "Officer Alvin Phippenney, 31, was shot and killed in John Schwer's, Arkansas Hall Saloon on Santa Fe Avenue in Pueblo about 12:30 p.m. on June 30, 1879. Officer Phippenney was attempting to disarm a 'ranchman' named John Baxter when the shooting occurred. Baxter and a man named James Moore were both armed and had been drinking with others. About noon the group had become loud, and Officer Phippenney responded to quiet the group down. A physical altercation ensued and Phippenney 'clinched' (grabbed and held) with Baxter, who was known to be dangerous when drinking. Baxter had stated that he would not give up his gun. Moore was also known to be carrying a gun. Witnesses stated that five or six shots were fired. The first shot was fired in the saloon then three or four were found in the street before they rolled back into the saloon where a final shot was heard. Officer Phippenney was shot and died about 15 minutes later. Before dying he stated that he had been shot by Baxter and another man. The fatal shot struck Phippenney in the back with the ball traveling thru his body and stopping just before breaking the skin of his chest. At the request of Pueblo Officer Bibly, the ball was removed from Phippenney's body by Dr. Cortwright. Witnesses stated that the ball was too small to have come from Baxter's gun, but that Moore's gun was smaller. Baxter received a scalp laceration and was also shot in the stomach during the fight.<br></br>A Coroner's jury listened to at least a dozen witnesses before finding that Alvin Phippenney came to his death from a pistol shot from the hands of John Baxter or James Moore. The Pueblo Chieftain newspaper stated that Baxter was mortally wounded, however he recovered enough to escape on July 8 from the Bartels building (part of the Lindell Hotel) where he was being held. Baxter just walked out the back door of the building which was only being guarded at the front door. The Chieftain expressed strong comments against the sheriff for his failure to properly guard a prisoner being held for the murder of a policeman. John Moore had left town on the day of the shooting, obtaining a horse and some money from a rancher after telling him he had shot a policeman in Pueblo and reportedly left for the Texas panhandle. No further information about either Baxter or Moore was found despite a $500.00 reward offered by the Pueblo City Council.",

        "Biography": "Elwin Merrill Slater was born in Illinois in April 1856. He married Zilpha May Eno in Tonica, Illinois, on February 27, 1881. He was survived by his wife and three children, LeeRoy, 21, Joseph, 17 and Ethel, 13.<br></br>A double funeral ceremony for Edwin Slater and Silas Martz (Marts) who were killed in the same incident was held on October 11 at the First Baptist Church at 9th and Court. Both were remembered for their dedication to duty and the love they showed to their families. Over 2,000 attended and it was noted that several hundred carriages were in the procession to Riverview Cemetery (not Roselawn Cemetery) where they were buried side by side.<br></br>Dr. Rice was so drunk that he didn't remember anything that occurred that evening. He apparently had a problem with alcohol for some time prior and had recently started adding cocaine and morphine to the mix. A trial was held in December and Rice's defense was 'temporary insanity'. A number of doctors testified to that, and Rice was found not guilty by a jury on December 31, 1903. Rice died from cancer in 1922 at the age of 63.",
        "Incident": "Officer Silas Martz (Marts), 43, was shot and killed on October 7, 1903, inside the Palace Drug store near 2nd and Main in Pueblo. Officer Marts was attempting to arrest Dr. Charles O. Rice, 44, who was drunk on alcohol and morphine and armed with a .45 caliber Colt revolver. About 8:00 p.m. Rice had become ‘crazed’. He threatened the employees and customers and chased them from the store. A crowd estimated at 1000 people eventually gathered and the police held them back not knowing what Rice would do. Finally, about 9:30 p.m. Officers Marts and Daly entered the building and attempted to talk to Rice in a friendly manner. Dr. Rice waited until Marts was about 8’ away and then fired one shot which struck Marts in the neck. With Daly’s help, Marts was able to stagger out of the store and across the street. He was attended to immediately, but he died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital from a severed jugular vein.<br></br>Officer Elwin Slater was outside, and the crowd was jeering the police officers. Slater determined that he would sneak in and crawl around to where Dr. Rice was. About 9:45 p.m. he entered the store with his hand on his holstered gun. As he moved to a crouched position a gunshot was heard, and Slater was shot in the right leg. He was helped out of the drug store and taken to the hospital. Investigation afterward found that Slater had partially drawn his gun and accidentally shot himself when he crouched down. The bullet left a hole on the inside of his holster and entered his thigh which caused internal hemorrhaging. He died the next day, October 8, at 5:20 p.m. believing that he’d been shot by Dr. Rice, but that was not the case.<br></br>The drug store did not have a rear entrance and that hampered the efforts to capture Dr. Rice. Just before Officer Slater entered the store others were working on a different plan. Detective F. Rubichaud, Assistant Fire Chief Campbell and Firefighter Davenport had gained access to an adjoining business, went to the basement, removed a partition and found Dr. Rice passed out in the basement of the drug store. Rice was arrested and charged with murder. Dr. Rice had been the family physician for the Marts family for 12 years which may be why he thought he could talk Rice out of using the gun.",

Officer Trout did manage to fire his gun one time and wound a suspect, Angelo Martino, 23, in the leg, before his gun jammed after the first shot. Investigating officers included Night Captain Reuben Pratt and Officers Dewey Roberts and John Hopkins. They found that Officer Trout had attempted to break up the group as they were causing a disturbance and shouting insults at people passing by. Sixteen people were arrested for the attack but twelve were released during the trial when witnesses were unable to positively identify them as being part of the gang that beat the officer. The four that were identified at the trial on March 6, 1930, were: Steve Buccambuso, 17, Sam Buccambuso, 21, their father, Gaetano (Tony) Buccambuso, 58, and Martino.

        "Incident": "Sergeant/Inspector Warren Watts, 53, collapsed at his home just after his morning run at 7:04 a.m. on June 16, 2012. His wife witnessed his fall and called 911. Pueblo Fire responded and he was transported to St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center and was pronounced dead at 7:41 a.m. from cardiac arrest. He had worked the day before and was preparing to go to work the day he collapsed. Although he had been scheduled to be off that day, his presence at work was requested by Undersheriff Justin Hall. Hall wanted him to meet with U.S. Secret Service agents regarding the upcoming visit of first lady Michelle Obama on June 20. Watts was the sheriff’s office liaison for security issues when prominent dignitaries visited Pueblo.<br></br>The death certificate listed the cause of death as “cardiac arrest due to coronary artery disease due to ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease).” The pathologist’s report indicated medical evidence was present to suggest that Watts suffered a non-fatal cardia event within 24 hours of his fatal heart attack. Although he was off duty when the fatal heart attack occurred, Medical Examiner Dr. James Wilkerson determined that Watts had suffered three heart attacks based on scar tissue – one the morning of his death, on the previous day and one “weeks” earlier.<br></br>The day before, Watts, while wearing SWAT equipment, worked a special event for more than five hours where he demonstrated SWAT specialized training techniques to the public. He also responded to a disturbance call that afternoon. Another officer noted that Watts complained of stomach pain and appeared to be “hot”. Five weeks earlier, May 10, Watts was on the scene of a hostage situation where a man was holding his 93-year-old mother hostage. When an opportunity presented itself, Watts, wearing full tactical gear, grabbed the hostage and carried her about 100 yards away from the danger. He then returned to the house and used a stun grenade and assisted in arresting the suspect. Witness noted that Watts was sweating profusely and was out of breath after this incident. Dr. Wilkerson stated that both events fit exactly into the timeline of the scaring he had observed in the heart. It, in his opinion, confirmed two prior heart attacks before his fatal one on June 16. It was also found that Watts had complained of indigestion after both of the events and had been taking over-the-counter pills for heartburn.",

        "Incident": "Central Pueblo Marshal Casper Zweifel, 37, died after being stabbed by a young man he had arrested for passing counterfeit silver dollars at businesses along Union Avenue. Marshal Zweifel had been watching for such a person and captured him at Henderson’s saloon, shortly after midnight on Friday, July 25, 1884. The Marshal was walking the subject up Union Avenue to the ‘calaboose’ when the man pulled out a pocketknife and stabbed the Marshal twice in the groin, once in each leg, then took off. Marshal Zweifel ran after him and fired several shots before collapsing after about 75 yards. Townspeople, hearing the shots. Found the Marshal and carried him into the Bessemer Exchange Saloon where he died almost immediately. Dr. Taylor, the county coroner, examined the Marshal and determined the cause of death. It was found that the stab wound in the left groin had severed the femoral artery and Marshal Zweifel had bled to death very quickly. The other wound in the right groin just missed the femoral artery there. The knife with a 4-inch blade was recovered at the scene where the Marshal was attacked.<br></br>A coroner’s inquest was held on July 25th while Marshal Zweifel’s body remained in the Bessemer Exchange. They examined several witnesses and determined that Marshal Zweifel came to his death from a loss of blood after being stabbed in the left thigh and that “said wound was inflicted by party or parties unknown, while deceased was performing his duty as Marshal of Central Pueblo, in attempting to arrest said unknown party for passing counterfeit money”. The counterfeit silver dollars were made of pewter which made them lighter than the real ones. The pewter ones also did not have a ‘ring’ to them.<br></br>The person that stabbed the Marshal was described as about 23-25 years old, 5’6” – 5’8” tall with a short mustache. He fled from town. The search began almost immediately but it was later in the morning when a reported sighting led Deputy Kelly and Mr. Henderson up Rock Canyon along the Santa Fe coal branch. They tracked and finally spotted the suspect and pursued him. When they had almost caught up, the suspect jumped into the Arkansas River with Kelly and Henderson jumping in after him. The chase continued on the south side of the river along the D&RG tracks before the suspect again took to the water, with his two pursuers following back to the north side of the river. The suspect then entered the river for a third time crossing back to the south side. Kelly and Henderson followed but Henderson struck something in the water and was injured, requiring Kelly to have to rescue him. By the time the men got across the river their suspect had escaped. Deputy Kelly and Mr. Henderson then returned to Pueblo to rest and get new clothing and money. Other suspects were picked up then released when it was determined they were not the one being looked for. Another suspect was picked up near Ojo at La Veta, but he got away by exiting the train at the steelworks and walked through town. No one was ever caught for the murder of Marshal Zweifel.",
